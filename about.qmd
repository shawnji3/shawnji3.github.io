One notable trend is the rise of pop genres, which have seen steady growth in popularity since the early 2000s. This reflects the increasing influence of urban culture and mainstream acceptance of hop as a dominant force in the music industry.

Conversely, r&b, rock genres have experienced a decline in popularity over the same period. This could be attributed to changing demographics and shifts in cultural preferences among younger audiences.

Salsa and soul genres have maintained a relatively stable presence throughout the years, indicating a consistent demand for these timeless musical styles.

It can be seen that from the graph, country musics experienced a decline in 2000 - 2008. However, it staged a comeback after 2010, and we can see it's maintaining a good popularity since then.

Overall, the trend lines paint a dynamic picture of how musical tastes have evolved over time, reflecting broader cultural shifts and societal changes. It can be seen that pop musics will still be the main stream, and other insights can be invaluable for music industry stakeholders, helping them to anticipate future trends and tailor their offerings to meet evolving consumer preferences.


## Column charts of different genres through 2000 - 2022
The columns chart provides a snapshot comparison of genre distribution between 2000 and 2022. It illustrates how the landscape of popular music has shifted over the past two decades.
```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
music_data <- read.csv("/Users/shawnji/Documents/billboard_used.csv") 

# List of genres
genres <- c('r&b',  'hip pop',  'soul', 'rock', 'country','pop')

# Function to replace genre with matching genre from the list
replace_genre <- function(genre_str, genre_list) {
  for (genre in genre_list) {
    if (genre %in% unlist(strsplit(gsub("\\[|\\]|'", "", genre_str), ", "))) {
      return(genre)
    }
  }
  return(NA)
}

# Modify 'Genres' column to have only the matching genre
music_data$Genres <- sapply(music_data$Genres, replace_genre, genre_list = genres)

# Remove rows with NA in 'Genres' column
music_data <- music_data[complete.cases(music_data$Genres), ]

# Reshape the data into long format
music_data_long <- reshape2::melt(music_data, id.vars = c("Year", "Genres"))

music_data_long %>%
  group_by(Year, Genres) %>% 
  count() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = n, fill = Genres)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill")
```
In 2000, rnb dominated the charts, representing the preferences of mainstream audiences at the time. However, by 2022, pop has emerged as the dominant genre, reflecting its growing influence and cultural significance. Whereas the percentage for rnb musics keeps decreasing.

This shift mirrors broader societal changes, including the rise of digital streaming platforms and the increasing diversification of music consumption habits. As a result, artists and record labels have adapted their strategies to capitalize on emerging trends and reach new audiences.
